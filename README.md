# eBike-Hack
for my 2016 Haibike

Do not test in public areas, i am not responsible for any damages to you, your bike or others

To use this code: 

get Microcontroller, i used Arduino
upload code to controller
find cables of the sensor
find power supply for the controller

take out bike battery
connect cables from sensor to input and ground + put high resistance between input and ground
connect cables to bike computer to output and ground
connect power supply to microcontroller
put back bike battery

test everything, i hope it works
maybe you have to adjust the triggerpoints in the code so the functions switch at the speed you want them to switch
the triggerpoints are for 28inch wheel
